# Snake
# Description
I did this for enjoyment. I really wanted to build another game and found this article by Robert Heaton that I decided to read, and made the classic game of Snake in Python.

# Gameplay

# Installation
Download the two .py files and ensure that they are placed in the same folder. Run the game.py file in a software of your choice. The game relies on keyboard input for each move. Input W, A, S, or D to change directions or just press Enter on a blank input to move ahead in the previous direction. The apples on the map are displayed as an * symbol. Have the snake head run over the apple to grow the snake. At the start, you can choose from some grid sizes and choose to have the snake not die from walls.

I would like to thank Robert Heaton for giving me the idea to make this game through his Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners series.

You can download this project to your computer and play the game as much as you want. It would actually make me happy to hear about someone doing that. You are welcome to make changes to the code and improve it where you believe it is applicable. I kindly request that you refrain from copying this project and using it as your submission in school or university. I would urge you to build a project from scratch because this was a very rewarding experience. Happy coding!
